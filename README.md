# BadC
The most horrid, disgusting C adaptation *ever*. It replaces normal commands like `printf`
with the worse version called `LithoGraphFormat` (Lithograph) was taken from the TheSaurus
of `print`. Things like `do/while` loops are replaced with `Commencing/TroughoutTheTime`
loops and `puts` is called `EstablishString`. It's awful *and* written in python.
