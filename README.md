# BadC
The most horrid, disgusting C adaptation *ever*. It replaces normal commands like `printf`
with the worse version called `LithoGraphFormat`. "Lithograph" was taken from the TheSaurus
of `print`. Things like `do/while` loops are replaced with `Commencing/TroughoutTheTime`
loops and `puts` is called `EstablishString`. It's awful *and* written in python.

## Install
The first thing you wanna do is to clone the project:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ElisStaaf/BadC
cd BadC
```
Then (if you haven't), you want to set up the original python source:
```sh
./python3.sh
```
Then, you want to compile the rewritten source in `badc`:
```sh
./install.sh
```
And now you have two versions of the language! Run `pybadc` for
the python version and run `badc` for the badc version. Good luck!
